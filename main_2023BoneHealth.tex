\section{Background}
Taiwan Medical Mission (TMM) aims to build medical capacity in the Republic of Somaliland through specialty training exchanges, outreach programs, and visiting scholar opportunities at Hargeisa Group Hospital (HGH).
% , and developing equipment maintenance capabilities

TMM has identified focus areas for 2024, including hemodialysis, critical care, orthopedics, non-communicable diseases (NCDs), nursing, telemedicine, visiting specialists, outreach campaigns, and establishing a visiting scholar program for HGH staff to train in Taiwan.

Key initiatives planned for 2024 are:

\begin{itemize}
%\item Hemodialysis - AV fistula surgery training, tele-nephrology conferences
\item Critical care - local and Taiwan ICU training
\item Orthopedics - local and Taiwan orthopedic surgeon training
%\item NCD clinic - partnership with NGO SAHA on NCD prevention
%\item Nursing fundamentals training program
\item Visiting specialists - Taiwanese specialists performing surgeries and training
\item Telemedicine for case discussions and virtual consults
%\item Teleradiology and telepathology platforms
\item Outreach campaigns on orthopedic/trauma, oral health, eye care, blood donation, and osteoporosis awareness
\item Visiting scholar program for HGH staff to train in Taiwan
%\item Procurement of medical equipment and maintenance training
\end{itemize}

%To support these initiatives, TMM has proposed a 
%budget of around USD 442,000 for 2024. This includes funding for relief supplies, visiting scholar program, equipment, transportation, and program activities.
% , upgrade equipment and maintenance capabilities,

%The goal is to exchange specialty knowledge, expand access to care, and improve public health outreach. This will build local capacity at HGH through collaboration between Somaliland and Taiwanese healthcare professionals.

To support capacity-building initiatives at Hargeisa Group Hospital, TMM has proposed an \textbf{Orthopedic and Trauma Surgery Collaboration and Outreach project} for 2023. 
This will enable knowledge exchange between Taiwanese orthopedic specialists and Somalilander surgeons. Orthopedics was a priority area because musculoskeletal injuries and conditions are highly prevalent, often requiring surgical intervention. With road traffic accidents being a significant cause of injury in Somaliland, improving local trauma surgery capabilities will save lives and prevent disabilities. The outreach component will also increase public awareness of injury prevention, first aid, and bone health. By facilitating hands-on training, virtual learning, and community outreach focused on orthopedic care, this initiative will significantly advance local capabilities while providing life-changing treatment to needy patients.


%%
\section{Objectives}
\begin{outline}
\1 To perform complex orthopedic or neurosurgery procedures, including fracture surgery, arthroscopic surgery, and spine surgery during \textbf{Dr. Kuo's visit}.
\1 To provide training and demonstration for local orthopedic surgeons on techniques and approaches.
\1 To increase access to orthopedic surgical care for patients in Somaliland.
\1 To promote community injury prevention and first aid awareness through outreach around \textbf{Save LIVES for World Trauma Day on October 17}.

%\1 To raise awareness of bone health and risks of vitamin D deficiency in women for \textbf{World Osteoporosis Day on October 20}.
% reasons for postpone it:
%Here are my thoughts on the questions about the outreach campaigns:
%1) Based on the holiday on 10/20, I would recommend focusing on the World Trauma Day outreach on 10/17 during Dr. Kuo's visit. This avoids overlap with the holiday closure.
%2) I agree transforming the Trauma Day outreach into a surgical campaign to treat injuries patients for free would be impactful. The awareness component could still be incorporated through education while patients are awaiting or recovering from surgery. 
%3) Given the short timeline until 10/20 and need to procure supplies, it makes sense to postpone the Osteoporosis Day outreach to a future date when there is more preparation time. The Trauma Day surgical camp will already capture many injury/fracture patients who are at risk of osteoporosis.
%In summary, my suggestions would be:
%- Focus on Trauma Day surgical outreach from 10/16-30 during Dr. Kuo's visit 
%- Postpone Osteoporosis Day outreach to a future date when supplies can be arranged
%- Combine awareness messaging for both causes into the Trauma Day camp (injury prevention and bone health education)
%Please let me know if you have any other questions! I'm happy to discuss further.

%Here is a section on the OPD settings:

\section{Operation Settings}
The orthopedic procedures will occur in the operating theater at Hargeisa Group Hospital, led by Dr. Ahmed and Dr. Kuo, with cooperation from orthopedic resident Dr. Hassan.
Dr. Kuo and neurosurgeons (Dr. Mustafe and Dr. Abdulhamid) will conduct the spine procedures. %C-arm x-ray imaging will be used as needed during surgery
Dr. Kuo's background in advanced spine surgery techniques will be very beneficial for exchanging knowledge and enhancing local capabilities in treating complex spine conditions through minimally invasive and endoscopic approaches. His expertise nicely complements the neurosurgical spine capabilities at HGH.
